To execute the program the following libraries have to be installed:
 - OpenGL (and its dependencies)

The submission contains a module called 'TheLSystem' and a program called 'ringsAndSquare', which
contains the code for the executables.

The main executable is called 'main.exe', and the others are spin-offs of this design. To
run the program, either call the 'main' function in GHCi, which
will produce the image that the 'main.exe' file produces

OR

run the executables (if possible).
